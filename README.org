#+title: Jupyter Ascending for Emacs

#+options: toc:nil

The Jupyter Ascending package facilitates editing and executing code in a Jupyter Python notebook from an ordinary Python buffer in Emacs. It does this by providing Emacs commands which utilize the [[https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Jupytext]] and [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tools for
- rendering .ipynb notebooks as standard Python source files,
- synchronizing the state of the 2 files, and
- executing code in the Jupyter notebook.
This allows users to work with Jupyter Python notebooks in the comfort of Emacs and make use of all the features they would normally have when editing Python code, such as code completion, linting, etc, as well as running the code with their systems Python interpreter.

* Features
- Synchronization: Editing and saving the Python buffer automatically updates the Jupyter notebook
- Cell execution commands: Run individual cells or the entire notebook
- Navigation tools: Jump between cells with simple commands
- Cell management: Create new cells and toggle between code and markdown types
- Enhanced markdown editing:
  - Edit markdown cells in dedicated markdown buffers (similar to Org mode's special edit mode)
  - Automatic comment insertion when pressing return in markdown cells
- Setup utilities: Commands for starting Jupyter notebooks and creating synchronized file pairs
* Installation
Jupyter Ascending is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/jupyter-ascending][MELPA]].
** Prerequisites
The following dependencies must be installed first.

If you haven't already installed [[https://jupyter.org/install][Jupyter]]:
#+begin_src sh
  pip install notebook
#+end_src

Then install the [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tool.
#+begin_src sh  
  pip install jupyter_ascending &&
  python3 -m jupyter nbextension    install jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py && \
  python3 -m jupyter nbextension     enable jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py && \
  python3 -m jupyter serverextension enable jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py
#+end_src

Installing [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] (the command line tool) should install [[https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][jupytext]], but if not, run ~pip install jupytext~.

** Configuration
Here's a sample installation which
- provides keybindings for common commands in ~jupyter-ascending-mode~ and
- uses the minor mode when opening python files with the =.sync= suffix just before the file extension.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package jupyter-ascending
    :ensure t
    :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                           (when (and buffer-file-name
                                      (string-match-p "\\.sync\\.py\\'" buffer-file-name))
                             (jupyter-ascending-mode 1))))
    :bind (:map jupyter-ascending-mode-map
                ("C-c C-k" . jupyter-ascending-execute-line)
                ("C-c C-a" . jupyter-ascending-execute-all)
                ("C-c C-n" . jupyter-ascending-next-cell)
                ("C-c C-p" . jupyter-ascending-previous-cell)
                ("C-c t" . jupyter-ascending-cycle-cell-type)
                ("C-c '" . jupyter-ascending-edit-markdown-cell)))
#+end_src
* Usage
*Create a notebook pair* with
    ~M-x jupyter-ascending-create-notebook-pair RET example RET~
Or, equivalently
    ~python3 -m jupyter_ascending.scripts.make_pair --base example~
This creates synced files: ~example.sync.py~ and ~example.sync.ipynb~

*If you have an existing Jupyter notebook, create a python file from it:*
    ~M-x jupyter-ascending-convert-notebook RET example.ipynb RET~
Or, equivalently,
    ~jupytext --to py:percent <file_name>~
and then add the ~.sync~ suffix to both files

*Start Jupyter and open the notebook:*
With ~example.sync.py~ open,
    ~M-x jupyter-ascending-start-notebook~
Or, equivalently,
    ~python3 -m jupyter notebook example.sync.ipynb~    

Within your Python file, a line starting with ~# %%~ deliminates a new cell.
#+begin_src python
  # %% [markdown]
  # This is a markdown cell.
  # Below is a code cell.

  # %%
  def g(x):
    return 3*x
#+end_src

When you edit and save the Python source file, you should see the Jupyter notebook running in your browser update straight away.

I recommend you create keybindings for all the following commands:
| Command                              | Description                            |
|--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| =jupyter-ascending-execute-line=       | Execute cell at cursor                 |
| =jupyter-ascending-execute-all=        | Execute all cells                      |
| =jupyter-ascending-next-cell=          | Move to next cell or create new cell   |
| =jupyter-ascending-previous-cell=      | Move to previous cell                  |
| =jupyter-ascending-edit-markdown-cell= | Edit Markdown cell in dedicated buffer |
| =jupyter-ascending-cycle-cell-type=    | Toggle between Markdown and code cells |

* Limitations
This package only works with Python notebooks because the [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tool only supports Python notebooks.  See here: https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending/issues/25
