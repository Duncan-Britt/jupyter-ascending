#+title: Jupyter Ascending for Emacs

The Jupyter Ascending package facilitates editing and executing code in a Jupyter Python notebook from an ordinary Python buffer in Emacs. It does this by providing Emacs commands which utilize the [[https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Jupytext]] and [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tools for
- rendering .ipynb notebooks as standard Python source files,
- synchronizing the state of the 2 files, and
- executing code in the Jupyter notebook.
This allows users to work with Jupyter Python notebooks in the comfort of Emacs and make use of all the features they would normally have when editing Python code, such as code completion, linting, etc.

* Features
- Synchronization: Editing and saving the Python buffer automatically updates the Jupyter notebook
- Cell execution commands: Run individual cells or the entire notebook
- Navigation tools: Jump between cells with simple commands
- Cell management: Create new cells and toggle between code and markdown types
- Enhanced markdown editing:
  - Edit markdown cells in dedicated markdown buffers (similar to Org mode's special edit mode)
  - Automatic comment insertion when pressing return in markdown cells
- Setup utilities: Commands for starting Jupyter notebooks and creating synchronized file pairs
* Installation
** Prerequisites
The following dependencies must be installed first.

If you haven't already installed [[https://jupyter.org/install][Jupyter]]:
#+begin_src sh
  pip install notebook
#+end_src

Then install the [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tool.
#+begin_src sh  
  pip install jupyter_ascending &&
  python3 -m jupyter nbextension    install jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py && \
  python3 -m jupyter nbextension     enable jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py && \
  python3 -m jupyter serverextension enable jupyter_ascending --sys-prefix --py
#+end_src

Installing [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] (the command line tool) should install [[https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][jupytext]], but if not, run ~pip install jupytext~.

** ~use-package~
Installing with Elpaca:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package jupyter-ascending
    :ensure (:host github :repo "Duncan-Britt/jupyter-ascending")
    :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                           (when (and buffer-file-name
                                      (string-match-p "\\.sync\\.py\\'" buffer-file-name))
                             (jupyter-ascending-mode 1))))
    :bind (:map jupyter-ascending-mode-map
                ("C-c C-k" . jupyter-ascending-execute-line)
                ("C-c C-a" . jupyter-ascending-execute-all)
                ("C-c C-n" . jupyter-ascending-next-cell)
                ("C-c C-p" . jupyter-ascending-previous-cell)
                ("C-c t" . jupyter-ascending-cycle-cell-type)
                ("C-c '" . jupyter-ascending-edit-markdown-cell)))
#+end_src
* Limitations
This package only works with Python notebooks because the [[https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending][Jupyter Ascending]] command line tool only supports Python notebooks.  See here: https://github.com/imbue-ai/jupyter_ascending/issues/25
